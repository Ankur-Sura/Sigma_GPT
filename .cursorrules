# Cursor Rules - Prevent Auto-Fixes to Critical Dependencies

# DO NOT auto-fix or suggest changes to langchain version constraint in AI/requirements.txt
# The constraint langchain>=0.3.0,<0.4.0 is INTENTIONAL and REQUIRED
# Changing it to <1.0.0 will break deployments due to dependency conflicts

# The constraint MUST stay <0.4.0 because:
# - langchain-qdrant<1.0.0 only works with langchain 0.3.x
# - langchain 0.4+ requires langchain-qdrant 1.x
# - langchain-qdrant 1.x breaks existing Qdrant data
# - This creates an impossible dependency conflict

# If Agent Review suggests changing langchain constraint, IGNORE IT
